SOVEREIGN PBND Lab/BFG ENGINE: Full-Fusion Neurotopological Audit
Data Validation Repository for Macroscopic Quantum Dynamics

Overview
This repository hosts the forensic and computational evidence of the SCDS-Phoenix Protocol (Sovereign Motor). The datasets provided demonstrate the convergence between cortical network topology and stable quantum states, offering a computational solution to the problem of thermal decoherence in biological systems.

This is more than a codebase; it is a Reality Audit.

Repository Contents
1. Manifold Atlas and Risk Mapping (11 Diagnostic Visualizations)
Advanced processing of "Mental States" via the Sovereign Motor. These images document:

Neural Risk Correlation Maps: Interdependency matrices between Network Fragmentation and Energy.

Entropy-Energy Criticality Maps: Identification of stable attractors under critical stress.

Brain State Phase Manifolds: 4D mapping of consciousness using Phi, Ricci Curvature, and Betti1 as coordinate axes.

2. scds_audit_20260208.csv (Downward Causality Log)
Millisecond-by-millisecond record of the Bio-Quantum interaction.

Key Evidence: Documentation of the t = 90.01s event, where a forced topological perturbation induces qubit collapse. Variance analysis confirms that topological influence on the quantum state is 171 times greater than background noise.

3. phoenix_multichannel.csv (Structural Defense Mechanism)
Raw data from the thermodynamic stability engine.

Critical Metric: A 0.89 correlation between topological complexity (Betti1) and network fragmentation. This validates the noise isolation mechanism that allows Phi to persist even under critical energy loads (7.389).

Scientific Significance
This repository serves as a direct computational counter-example to traditional decoherence models. Through Negative Ricci Curvature, it is demonstrated that brain geometry acts as an entropy sink, allowing Orchestration (Orch OR) to transition from a theoretical framework to a reproducible engineering process.

"Structure does not merely support function; structure dictates the physical reality of the observer."
